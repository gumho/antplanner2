        <p>To All AntPlanners,</p>

        <p>After 11 years, I have decided to take the AntPlanner planner offline. Life is crazy and I haven't had nearly the energy needed to sustain this project in the past few years.</p>

        <p>The AntPlanner project started in 2010 during my senior year as a UCI Informatics undergraduate student. <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~mlyang/scheduler/">Zot Scheduler</a> was the hot thing at the time - everybody I knew used Zot Scheduler! Then suddenly, the site was taken offline one day. Sensing an opportunity, I rushed to fill the UCI web planner void. There were a few others doing the same - I know because we had all contacted Michael to link our planner websites on the Zot Scheduler homepage ðŸ˜†. It was after the link referral when AntPlanner exploded. A decade has passed and now it is my turn to pass on the baton.</p>

        <p>Some fun stats: According to Google Analytics, AntPlanner has seen 395,646 unique users and a little over 2 million page views since 2017. Unfortunately, I don't have any user stats prior to 2017 but the day with the largest spike in traffic occurred on January 5, 2015 with over 12k page views!</p>

        <p>If you are looking for a new UCI web planner, I would recommend <a href="https://zotcourse.appspot.com/">ZotCourse</a> by Tristan Jogminas. ZotCourse is a supercharged fork of AntPlanner with many advanced features. If you are looking to create your own fork of AntPlanner or are looking for inspiration, I will continue to make the code available on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/gumho/antplanner2">https://github.com/gumho/antplanner2</a>.</p>

        <p>I'd like to thank everyone who supported and enjoyed using AntPlanner. Also, a special thanks to all the AntPlanner contributors over the years (let me know if I missed anybody):</p>

        <p>If you would like to get in touch with me, send a message over to the following ðŸ…¶ðŸ…¼ðŸ…°ðŸ…¸ðŸ…» account: antplanner2.</p>
